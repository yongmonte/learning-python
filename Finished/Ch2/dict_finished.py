# Dictionary: a key-value data structure
mydict = {
    "one": 1,
    "two": 2,
    3: "three",
    4.5: "four point five",
}

# dictionaries are accessed via keys
print(mydict["one"])
print(mydict[3])

# you can also set dictionary data by creating a new key
mydict["seven"] = 7
print(mydict)

# Trying to access a nonexistent key will produce an error
# print(mydict["blarg"])

# To avoid this, you can use the "in" operator to see if a key exists
print("two" in mydict)
print("blarg" in mydict)

# You can retrieve all of the keys and values from a dictionary
print(mydict.keys())
print(mydict.values())

# You can also iterate over all the items in a dictionary
for key, val in mydict.items():
    print(key, val)
