# Working with modules of code

# import the math module, which contains features for working with mathematics
import math

# print("The square root of 16 is", math.sqrt(16))
# print("Pi is", math.pi)

# import a specific part of the module so you can refer to it more easily
from math import pi
# print("Pi is", pi)

# import a module and give it a different name
import random as r
print(r.randint(100,200))

# the math module contains lots of pre-built functions


# in addition to functions, some modules contain useful constants 


# Generate a random number between 100 and 200


# try some of the math functions for yourself here:

# Use the 3rd party tabulate module to print tabulated data:

# Sample data
data = [
  ["Product", "Price", "Stock"],
  ["Laptop", 999.99, 45],
  ["Mouse", 24.99, 128],
  ["Keyboard", 59.99, 89]
]

# Create a formatted table
